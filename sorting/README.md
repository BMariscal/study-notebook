**Quicksort vs Merge sort vs Timsort vs Heapsort**



*   Quicksort: worst time complexity: n^2
    *   stable: no
    *   Average and best time complexity: n*log(n)
    *   Space complexity: O(log n)
*   Mergesort: worst time complexity: n*log(n)
    *   stable: yes
    *   space complexity: O( n)
    *   Average and best time complexity: n*log(n)
*   Timsort: worst time complexity: n*log(n)
    *   stable: yes
    *   space complexity: O( n)
    *   Average and best time complexity: n*log(n), O(n)
*   Heapsort: worst time complexity: n*log(n)
    *   stable: no
    *   space complexity: O(1)
    *   Average and best time complexity: n*log(n), O(n)
