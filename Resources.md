Hello you! 


Looking for resources that will help you self-study CS concepts? Look no further. This is the place.
I've spent many many hours sleuthing the interwebs (my #1 favorite hobby) and have found the following helpful resources. 
I hope you find them as helpful as I did. 

"Wow, there are a lot of links here. How am I going to do all this in less than a year?" You won't. Pick what works for you. We all learn differently so find the resources that work best for you.

### What you need to know:
* [Asymptotic notation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/asymptotic-notation)
* Search (Binary search, linear search)
* Sorting Algos (Quick sort, Merge sort, Heap sort ... know their time and space complexities, and whether they're stable or unstable)
* String manipulation
* Array manipulation
* Bit manipulation (Background knowledge needed: The Base-2 System and the 8-bit Byte, [logic gates](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/computers-101/logic-gates-and-circuits/a/logic-gates), bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, etc.))
* Sets
* Hash maps (hash functions...what are they? how would you make one?)
* Queues
* Recursion
* Backtracking 
* DFS and BFS 
* Dynamic Programming (DP)
* Linked lists (both singly and doubly linked) - reverse a link list, find a node in the middle of a link list, find a cycle
* Binary Search Tree (AVL trees are optional)
* Heaps (Min and Max)
* Tries
* Graphs (directed and undirected graphs, acyclic and cyclic graphs, adjacency list vs adjacency matrix, detect a cycle, topological sorting, Finding connected components, Minimum Spanning Tree, DFS, BFS, Shortest Path Algos)
* How to do recursion in your sleep 


Problems I've been asked:
* DFS problems (Leetcode mediums and hards)
* BFS problems (Leetcode mediums)
* Backtracking problems (Leetcode mediums)
* Implementing recursive problems using DP
