Hello you! 


Looking for resources that will help you self-study CS concepts? Look no further. This is the place.
I've spent many many hours sleuthing the interwebs (my #1 favorite hobby) and have found the following helpful resources.
I hope you find them as helpful as I did. 

"Wow, there are a lot of links here. How am I going to do all this in less than a year?" You won't. Pick what works for you. We all learn differently so find the resources that work best for you.

### What you need to know:
* [Asymptotic notation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/asymptotic-notation)

    * Counting sort
    * Know of Timsort
* Implement a Stack & a Queue using arrays
* String manipulation
* Array manipulation

* Queues
* Recursion
* Backtracking 
* Greedy Algorithms

* Dynamic Programming (DP)
* Linked lists (both singly and doubly linked) - reverse a link list, find a node in the middle of a link list, find a cycle
* Binary Search Trees (AVL trees are optional) - Print a binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order - all three of them) and BFS
* Heaps (Min and Max)
* Tries
* Graphs 

    * directed and undirected graphs
    * acyclic and cyclic graphs
    * adjacency list vs adjacency matrix
