# In computer science, counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects
# according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm.
# It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using
# arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.
# Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values,
# so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater
# than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix sort,
# that can handle larger keys more efficiently
