Count the number of connected components in a Directed Graph

++++++++Directed Graph Strongly Connected Components++++++
\n
Compute the number of strongly connected components of a given directed graph with ùëõ vertices and
ùëö edges.


\n


1. initiliaze component count, dfs visit nodes, add nodes to visited, append nodes to stack
2. reverse graph
3. clear visited
4. pop nodes from stack, if not visited, add to component count
