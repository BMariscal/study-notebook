[x] Hash Table
-------------

| Algorithm      | Average	Worst case |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Space	O(n)    | O(n)      |
| Search	O(1)  | O(n)      |
| Insert	O(1)     | O(n)      |
| Delete	O(1)   | O(n)      |


	□ Dictionary: Abstract Data Type (ADT)
		○ Maintain set of items, each with a key
			§ Insert(item)
			§ Delete(item)
			§ Search(key) 
	□ How to handle hash table collisions:
		○ Chaining = linked list.	
		○ Open Addressing= All entry records
		 are stored in the bucket array itself.

Set Bit
------
``````
def set_bit(x, position):
  mask = 1 << position
  return x | mask

  x = 00000110
  position = 00000101
  mask = 00100000



calculation:
x 00000110
mask 00100000
output = 00100110

``````
Clear Bit
------
``````
sef clear_bit(x, position):
  mask = 1 << position
  return x & ~mask


x 00000110
position 00000010
mask 00000100
~mask 11111011


      x 00000110
& ~mask 11111011

         00000010

``````

Flip Bit
------
``````
def flip_bit(x, position):
  mask = 1 << position
  return x ^ mask


x 01100110
position 00000010
mask 00000100


x      01100110
^ mask 00000100

----------------
      01100010




``````

Left Shift
-------

Shift the binary digits by n, pad 0's on the right    


Each shift is a multiply by 2 (unless there's overflow)



Right Shift
--------

Shift the binary digits by n, pad 0's on the left

Each shift is a divide by 2 with round towards negative infinity




Is Bit Set
------

``````

def is_bit_set(x, position):
	shifted = x >> position
	return shifted & 1
	

X        01100110           00000011        shifted 
Position 00000101         & 00000001              1
Shifted   00000011          00000001    

``````
	
BIT TRICKS
--------
``````
Even: check the right-most bit

(x & 1) == 0


CHECK IF POWER OF TWO

                     1000
(x & x-1) == 0    &  0111
                     0000
``````
Exercise
---------
Write a function to count the number of
Bits that are different between two numbers
``````
def num_diff_bits(a, b): 
	count = 0 
	diff = a ^ b
	while diff != 0:
		 if diff & 1:
			 count += 1 
		diff = diff >> 1 
	return count

[X] Trees

```
Height(tree)
if tree == nil: return 0 
return 1 + Max(Height(tree.left),Height(tree.right))


Size(tree)
if tree == nil: return 0 
return 1 + Size(tree.left) + Size(tree.right)
```





DFS

* Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: best: O(log n) - avg. height of tree worst: O(n)
* Inorder (DFS: left, self, right)
* Postorder (DFS: left, right, self)
* Preorder (DFS: self, left, right)

 In-order: This is InOrderTraversal is what we might use to print all the nodes of a binary search tree in alphabetical order.
  ```
  InOrder(tree)
      if tree == nil: return
      InOrder(tree.left)
       print(tree.key)
      InOrder(tree.right)
  ```
 In a post-order traversal, we evaluate all children fully before evaluating a node itself.
  ```
  PostOrder(tree)
      if tree == nil: return
      PostOrder(tree.left)
      PostOrder(tree.right)
      print(tree.key)
  ```
 In a pre-order traversal, we evaluate the node fully before evaluating a node's children.
 ```
 PreOrder(tree)
  if tree == nil: return
  print(tree.key)
  PreOrder(tree.left)
  PreOrder(tree.right)
  ```
 BFS
 
* Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: best: O(1), worst: O(n/2)=O(n)
 
 ``````
 levelTransversal(tree)
  if tree == nil: return

  Queue q
  q.Enqueue(tree) //put root of tree in queue
  while not q.Empty():
    node <- q.Dequeue() // while queue is not empty, we're going to pull a node off
    print(node)

    if node.left =/= nil: // if left child exists, queue it 
      q.Enqueue(node.left)
    if node.right =/= nil:
      q.Enqueue(node.right) //if right child exists, queue it
 
 
 
 ``````

 [x] BST
-------------
 Average O(log n) searching, insertion, deletion
 
 Worst O(n) searching, insertion, deletion
 
 Space O(n)
 
 
 BST array representation:
 
     If node is at index i
     
     Its left-child is at 2*i + 1
     
     Its right-child is at 2*i + 2
     
     Its parent is at (i -2) // 2
 
 
AVL

     The difference in height between left and right must always be <= 1
     
 
 
 2-3 Tree
 
 
 ![2-3](https://miro.medium.com/max/1568/1*5joMecsfqUcIloiV4Y-rcA.jpeg)
 
 B-Tree
 
 
 1. A node can have more than 2 child nodes
 2. It's self-balancing
 [b-trees](https://medium.com/basecs/busying-oneself-with-b-trees-78bbf10522e7)
 
 Every pointer has a pointer to a child-node as well as a pointer to a record (in disk).
 Useful for implementing multi-level indexing. 


 -------------
 
 [x] Heap
-------------

1. Heap

2. Insert & Delete

    Insert element in leaf and adjusting upwards.
    Delete element in root, move leaf descendant to root while maintaining balanced tree, then adjust new root by comparing it with its descendants. Maintain min/max heap nature.  
3. Heap Sort

    Create heap, delete root
    
4. Heapify

    The process of converting a binary tree into a Heap data structure.

5. Priority Queue

Binary Heap construction O(n)

    Polling/removing                  O(log(n))
    
    Peeking/seeing at root            O(1)
    
    Adding                            O(log(n))
